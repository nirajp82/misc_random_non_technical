## Key Metrics Explained — What to Look For & Why

---

### 1️⃣ **Earnings & Valuation Metrics (Most Important)**

These tell you whether the stock is priced reasonably relative to the company’s earnings, sales, and book value.

* **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**

  * **What it is:** Price per share divided by earnings per share.
  * **Why it matters:** Shows how much investors are willing to pay for \$1 of earnings.
  * **Good to see:**

    * For healthcare/pharma: A P/E between 15 and 25 is typical.
    * P/E \~11.69 (your stock) suggests undervaluation or stable earnings, which can be attractive if the company is solid.
  * **Red flags:** Very low (<10) might mean trouble or market fear; very high (>30) suggests overvaluation or high growth expectations.

* **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio**

  * **What it is:** Market cap divided by total sales.
  * **Why it matters:** Useful if earnings fluctuate (common in pharma with R\&D costs).
  * **Good to see:** 2 to 5 is normal for drug manufacturers. Your stock’s 3.19 is healthy.
  * **Red flags:** P/S > 10 may be too expensive.

* **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**

  * **What it is:** Market cap divided by net book value (assets - liabilities).
  * **Why it matters:** Helps understand valuation relative to company’s asset base.
  * **Good to see:** For pharma, 3–7 is typical because patents and R\&D are not fully reflected on the balance sheet.
  * Your stock’s 4.18 is right in line.

* **Dividend Yield**

  * **What it is:** Annual dividend divided by current price.
  * **Why it matters:** Indicates income return.
  * **Good to see:** Stable yields around 2–4% are attractive in healthcare.
  * Your stock’s \~4% yield is solid and attractive for income investors.

---

### 2️⃣ **Risk & Market Sentiment**

Measures how risky or stable the stock is, and how the market feels about it.

* **Beta (5-Year)**

  * **What it is:** Volatility compared to the overall market (1 = market).
  * **Why it matters:** Lower beta = less price swings; higher beta = more volatile.
  * **Good to see:**

    * Healthcare stocks are defensive, so beta < 1 is typical and desirable.
    * Your stock’s 0.38 is very low volatility — good if you want stability.

* **Short Interest %**

  * **What it is:** Percent of float shares sold short (betting stock price will fall).
  * **Why it matters:** High short interest can signal negative sentiment or potential for short squeeze.
  * **Good to see:** Low short interest (<5%) is safer.
  * Your stock’s 1.53% is very low — market skepticism is minimal.

* **Short Ratio**

  * **What it is:** Days needed for shorts to cover based on average volume.
  * **Good to see:** Below 3 is normal, indicating no extreme pressure.
  * Your stock’s 2.39 fits well.

* **Shares Short Change**

  * A large decrease (-16.24%) suggests shorts are losing interest — bullish sign.

### 3️⃣ **Liquidity & Trading**

Important to ensure you can buy or sell shares easily without big price impact.

  * Your stock: 15.9M vs. 16.0M — very liquid.

  | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Bid Price**      | \$80.30 – Highest price a buyer is willing to pay for the stock.                                        |
  | **Bid Size**       | 10 – Number of shares buyers want to buy at the bid price.                                              |
  | **Ask Price**      | \$80.80 – Lowest price a seller is willing to accept for the stock.                                     |
  | **Ask Size**       | 1 – Number of shares sellers want to sell at the ask price.                                             |
  | **Spread**         | \$0.50 – Difference between Ask and Bid price (\$80.80 - \$80.30).                                      |
  | **Why it matters** | Smaller spread = better liquidity and lower trading cost. Larger spread = less liquidity and more cost. |

  **Key Concepts Recap**

  * **Bid Price:** The highest price someone is willing to pay. If you sell immediately, you’ll get this.
  * **Ask Price:** The lowest price someone is willing to accept. If you buy immediately, you’ll pay this.
  * **Bid/Ask Size:** Shares available at those prices.
  * **Bid-Ask Spread:** Cost of immediacy. Smaller = more liquid.
